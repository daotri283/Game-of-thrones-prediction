# Game-of-thrones-prediction
There are approximately 2,000 characters in A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. This book series was the inspiration for the HBO series Game of Thrones. My tasks as a future master of analytics are to predict which characters in the series will live or die, and give data-driven recommendations on how to survive in Game of Thrones. 

Steps that I have taken to analyze this data set:
  1: Clean the data 
  2: Data visualization 
  3: Machine learining alogrithm with cros validation 
  4: Chosing the best machine learing alogrithm
